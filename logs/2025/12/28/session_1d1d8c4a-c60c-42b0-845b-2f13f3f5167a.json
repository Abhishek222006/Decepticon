However, I can guide you through the process of restarting the Streamlit server and running the Streamlit app manually. Here's how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Restart the Streamlit Server\n1. **Stop any running Streamlit process**:\n   - Open your terminal.\n   - Run the following command to find and stop any running Streamlit processes:\n     ```bash\n     pkill -f streamlit\n     ```\n   - If you want to verify that the process is stopped, you can run:\n     ```bash\n     ps aux | grep streamlit\n     ```\n\n2. **Check if Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running**:\n   - To check if Docker is installed and running:\n     ```bash\n     docker --version\n     ```\n   - To check if Docker Compose is installed:\n     ```bash\n     docker-compose --version\n     ```\n   - If Docker is not running, start it:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl start docker\n     ```\n\n3. **Start Docker and Docker Compose if needed**:\n   - If Docker or Docker Compose is not installed, you can install them using the following commands:\n     - For Docker:\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt-get update\n       sudo apt-get install docker.io\n       ```\n     - For Docker Compose:\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt-get install docker-compose\n       ```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Run the Streamlit App\n1. Navigate to the directory containing your Streamlit app:\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/your/streamlit/app\n   ```\n\n2. Run the Streamlit app:\n   ```bash\n   streamlit run your_app_name.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Show Terminal Output Logs\n- The terminal will display logs as the Streamlit app starts. You can monitor these logs to ensure the app is running correctly.\n\n---\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, let me know!",
