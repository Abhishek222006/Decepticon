Network Discovery & Port Scanning**\n- **nmap**:\n  - **Host Discovery**: Identify live hosts on the network using options like `-sn`, `-PE`, `-PP`, or `-PM`.\n  - **Port Scanning**: Detect open ports and services using techniques like `-sS` (stealth), `-sT` (TCP connect), or `-sU` (UDP).\n  - **Service Detection**: Identify service versions and vulnerabilities with `-sV` and `--script vuln`.\n  - **OS Detection**: Determine the operating system of target hosts using `-O`.\n\n---\n\n### **2. DNS Intelligence Gathering**\n- **dig**:\n  - **DNS Record Lookup**: Retrieve DNS records like `A`, `MX`, `NS`, `TXT`, and `CNAME`.\n  - **Zone Transfers**: Attempt to extract all DNS records for a domain using `AXFR`.\n  - **Reverse Lookups**: Resolve IP addresses to domain names using `-x`.\n  - **Trace Queries**: Follow the DNS resolution path with `+trace`.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Domain Intelligence**\n- **whois**:\n  - **Domain Registration Details**: Retrieve information about domain ownership, registration dates, and administrative contacts.\n  - **IP Allocation Information**: Identify the organization responsible for an IP address range.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Web Service Analysis**\n- **curl**:\n  - **HTTP/HTTPS Reconnaissance**: Inspect web server headers, SSL/TLS configurations, and authentication mechanisms.\n  - **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieve server banners and version information.\n  - **Proxy Testing**: Test connectivity through proxies and analyze responses.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Additional Reconnaissance Tools**\n- **host**: Simple DNS lookup utility.\n- **nslookup**: Interactive DNS query tool.\n- **ping**: Test connectivity to a target host.\n- **traceroute**: Map the network path to a target.\n- **nc (netcat)**: Test network connections and grab service banners.\n- **telnet**: Interact with services and grab banners.\n- **wget**: Download web content for analysis.\n- **nikto**: Scan for web server vulnerabilities.\n- **dirb/gobuster**: Discover hidden directories and files on web servers.\n- **enum4linux**: Enumerate SMB services on Linux targets.\n- **smbclient**: Interact with SMB services.\n- **snmpwalk**: Enumerate SNMP services.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Parallel Execution Strategy**\n- **Terminal Sessions**: Use multiple terminal sessions to execute independent reconnaissance tasks concurrently. For example:\n  - Run `nmap` in one session while performing DNS queries with `dig` in another.\n  - Use `curl` to analyze web services while `whois` gathers domain intelligence.\n\n---",
