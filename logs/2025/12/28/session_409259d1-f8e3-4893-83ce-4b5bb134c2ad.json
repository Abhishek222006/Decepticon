      "content": "**STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE**\nThe reconnaissance phase is critical for identifying the target surface and gathering publicly available information. This phase will establish the foundation for all subsequent actions by mapping the attack surface and identifying potential vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**ATTACK STRATEGY**\n1. **Target Surface Identification**: Identify all publicly accessible assets, including domains, subdomains, IP addresses, and open ports.\n2. **Public Information Gathering**: Collect publicly available information such as WHOIS records, DNS records, SSL certificates, and any exposed APIs or services.\n3. **Passive Reconnaissance**: Use passive techniques to avoid detection while gathering intelligence.\n4. **Active Reconnaissance**: Perform controlled active scans to identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on the target.\n\n---\n\n**TACTICAL DIRECTIVES**\n1. **Domain and Subdomain Enumeration**:\n   - Use tools like `sublist3r`, `amass`, or `dnsrecon` to identify subdomains.\n   - Perform DNS lookups to map the target's infrastructure.\n2. **WHOIS and SSL Certificate Analysis**:\n   - Use `whois` to gather registration details.\n   - Analyze SSL certificates for additional domain information.\n3. **Port Scanning**:\n   - Use `nmap` to scan for open ports and services.\n   - Identify potential entry points for further exploitation.\n4. **Service Fingerprinting**:\n   - Use tools like `nmap` or `masscan` to identify services running on open ports.\n   - Document findings for further analysis.\n\n---\n\n**COORDINATION PLAN**\n- **Parallel Execution**: Use separate terminal sessions for passive and active reconnaissance to maximize efficiency.\n- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate sessions for domain enumeration, port scanning, and service fingerprinting.\n- **Findings Consolidation**: Ensure all findings are documented and shared for the next phase.\n\n---\n\n**AGENT COORDINATION**\n- **Next Agent Transfer**: Transfer to Reconnaissance for detailed execution of the reconnaissance phase.\n\n---\n\n**SWARM STATUS**\n- **Current Operation State**: Reconnaissance phase initiated.\n- **Coordination Needs**: Ensure all findings are documented and shared for the next phase.",
